          <h4>The history behind beverages</h4>
          <p>
            From the very beginning of human history, water was the essential
            drink for survival. But as societies evolved, so did their thirst
            for variety. Thousands of years ago, early humans discovered
            fermentation—likely by accident—which led to the creation of
            primitive alcoholic beverages made from fruits, honey, and grains.
            In ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, beer became a staple, brewed from
            barley and consumed daily. Meanwhile, wine emerged in the
            Mediterranean, especially in Greece and Rome, where it was often
            mixed with water and used in both social and religious rituals. Milk
            also became common as people began domesticating animals like cows
            and goats.
