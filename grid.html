        <h4>The history behind beverages</h4>
        <p>
          From the very beginning of human history, water was the essential
          drink for survival. But as societies evolved, so did their thirst for
          variety. Thousands of years ago, early humans discovered
          fermentation—likely by accident—which led to the creation of primitive
          alcoholic beverages made from fruits, honey, and grains. In ancient
          Mesopotamia and Egypt, beer became a staple, brewed from barley and
          consumed daily. Meanwhile, wine emerged in the Mediterranean,
          especially in Greece and Rome, where it was often mixed with water and
          used in both social and religious rituals. Milk also became common as
          people began domesticating animals like cows and goats.
