      <h4>The history behind beverages</h4>
      <p>
        From the very beginning of human history, water was the essential drink
        for survival. But as societies evolved, so did their thirst for variety.
        Thousands of years ago, early humans discovered fermentation—likely by
        accident—which led to the creation of primitive alcoholic beverages made
        from fruits, honey, and grains. In ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, beer
        became a staple, brewed from barley and consumed daily. Meanwhile, wine
        emerged in the Mediterranean, especially in Greece and Rome, where it
        was often mixed with water and used in both social and religious
        rituals. Milk also became common as people began domesticating animals
        like cows and goats.
      </p>

      <p>During the Middle Ages, new beverages entered the scene.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Tea</em> was cultivated in China and spread to Japan, while coffee,
        originating in Ethiopia, gained popularity across the Islamic world.
        Distillation techniques developed during this time gave rise to stronger
        drinks like spirits and liquors.
      </p>
      <br />The colonial era brought global trade, and with it, the widespread
      distribution of coffee, tea, chocolate, and sugar. These ingredients
      transformed drinking habits around the world, especially in Europe and the
      Americas. With the Industrial Revolution came mass production. Bottling,
      refrigeration, and pasteurization made beverages safer and more widely
      available.
      <p>
        Carbonated drinks like soda were invented, and milk and juices could be
        stored longer. In the modern era, innovation exploded. Soft drinks,
        energy drinks, and bottled water became everyday items. More recently,
        health trends have led to the rise of smoothies, plant-based milks, and
        low-sugar alternatives, reflecting a growing awareness of nutrition and
        wellness.
